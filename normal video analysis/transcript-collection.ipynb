       "\"what's up you there's our friends is Janice here and welcome to my channel in this video I'm gonna show you how to take a publicly available data set for Kovach 19 which is coronavirus run some Python code on it in order to clean it and transform it and then open a blank power bi file and create this power bi dashboard from scratch in the dashboard we have some summary statistics at the top any map where you can visualize where is the virus end by how much then I have some trends and forecasting where you can actually see how many cases should we expect going forward per day how many calories how many deaths then I have some country-region analytics then we have some proteins and staying analytics and at the end I compare coronavirus with some other viruses additionally the whole dashboard is actually interconnected so if we slice a country for example let's say China then I select China everything is going to change and it's going to adjust to your selection so you can see these are the states only in China these numbers are just for China the forecast down here is just for China and all the analytics in general are just for China I have published the report in the web so you can actually go and access it and play with it and I will try to update this report twice a week for a few weeks going forward with new data as long as these guys over here keep posting new data in their github right before we start with the code I would like to say a big thank you to everyone who supported me until now so we are 2,000 strong and growing so thank you very much and if you are new to this channel and you're passionate about data science I would really appreciate it if you click the like button subscribe to my channel and enable notifications for all my future data science videos right so the first thing you do is to get the raw data so you have to head over into Johns Hopkins University Center github repository I will have all the links in the description below by the way and click on download and then download the files as zip so this is going to download all the files we'll have over here then if you open this file you're going to see another file then open this one again then the raw data we need is going to be the coveted 19 data so we click on it and we only want to use the time series data so these three files over here which is the confirmed cases that there's in the recovered cases next you will have to set your Python anacondas environment up in order to bring those three files in and start running code if you're new with Python in our Kunduz I'm going to have links in the description that can help you get started by the way you can download the whole code from a github repository in case you don't want to type it yourself and so first I load the Kovach picture and then I load the libraries I'm about you so I'm not actually gonna use all of these libraries I'm just using OS man PI pandas in day time so you don't have to load everything and then I load the three files in so here is where a lot the three files so the first file is that confirm the second one is the test and the third one is a covet and just to investigate these three files now you can see that all three files have prominence and state country and region lot long and then the day it's all the days from the 22nd of January all the way to the 29th of February which is actually yesterday something to note here is that the values are actually cumulative so for this state over here on the 22nd that we have one case and on the 23rd to have nine cases it does not mean that on the 23rd there was nine new cases the cumulative number was nine so it was actually 18 cases plus one over here equals nine new cases and then the same story goes on and on and on so we will have to do some data manipulation in order to calculate the daily values per state and per region additionally in fuel running this analysis any time after today which you will probably do then expect to have more days and more data points over here right the next thing you want to do is to ante what the data so this means that we want to take all these state columns over here and put them into a new code called date ask new rows so one under the other and next to it hot the values and in order to help you understand what I wear I wanna get I'm just gonna run one of the data frames down here so you can see from this data frame over here where we have provenance province state region a lot long and then all the day it we just have province a region lot law then a new column which is state which all these states went into this new column down here and all the values per day went into the value column here and the way to run this all you have to do is use a function called melt which is basically an pivoting the data you want to specify your ID variables which is the ones you want to keep a scholars so it's the state as you can see then we have the region then you have the lot and then we have the long then I need to specify the new column I want to create which is state which in this state column everything that is the leftover is going to go in this state column which is all to date and then it creates another column itself which is values which are the values we have in each of these columns and then I ran these three times just because I have three data frames there contempt cases deaths and recovery and as you can see the shape has changed from before being a hundred and nineteen pros and forty three columns to four thousand six hundred rows now and six columns for all three data sets and the reason we did this is so that we can easily aggregate the data right now by by you bestest having to include all these states as columns in our applications right moving on the next thing I've done about here is that I have converted the dates into actual date time so now python identifies these field as a date and not as an object or a stream which it was probably object or string up here then I have renamed the value so what I've done here is that because we have three different data sets we have and we have value in all three of them we just have to point by you to the right mapping so the first dataset which is confirmed I'm saying I mean invite you to confirm the second day that said which is the tails I'm renaming into tents and the third one into a column right the next thing I want to do is to investigate if our data set or data frame has any values so this code down here it just tells us that the state proteins column has 2145 now values now in order to get around this just because both proteins state and country and region are actually location fields what I've done is that i said that when the province or state is not then fill it up with the country or region so if this column is now take it from this column over here and i've repeat the same thing for all three data set but now we don't have any null values as you can see down here right the next thing i did is to join these three datasets together so I've started by joining the confirm with the deaths to start to it and named it as full join I have actually used a full join but that was before I realize the format of the data it's that even if the country doesn't have any cases they are still gonna have for the day sorry they are still gonna have their own row so whether you run a full chilling or left join things are going to work as fine and the way to do this is that we're saying the first data frame don't merge them the second data frame and then I select the columns I need from the second data frame and then I'm joining on all state province state country and date on both of them and the second step of that is that I have taken the outcome of these first joints of food ran over here and then enjoyed the third dataset which is actually their cover and I'll repeat the same process as above so the outcome is that the outcome you see down here actually this is the first five rows so we have state regional long log date and then we have all confirmed this and recovered in one day that's it then I just checked about any null values after my join which I don't I you can also see them adjourn kept exactly the same row as above which means there was no duplication on my join the next thing I've done is that I have added a new column so in my dataset so let me just visualize it so you can see this new column is just a be his new column is just a month and the year next to each other so I can actually use it on my visualization here the month and the year as you can see and then moving on the next thing I did it was to break the data by date so that it firstly I assume that this seven file that they provided to us so if you go back to the raw data you've downloaded you go back and you click on the daily reports I assume that all these files are actually going to be daily numbers so what I did is that I have write a while look down here to bring all those files in together and try to use them as daily numbers however is not the case those files are still cumulative numbers but when I use those or you use these data that we created you're still gonna have the same numbers so that's why I've come and this out you don't have to use those files you can get all the data from your cumulative by doing some manual stuff to break it down break the data now by day I have used the following methodology first of all I have created a test test where our filter out from my whole day that said only one state is an hooey here in order to be able to clearly understand what's going on then I have created another data frame that has the same data as these tests so now I have two data frames to have the same data then from the seven dataframe 1/2 I have created a new column called data date minus 1 which are took the tape : and I did date plus 1 day ahead forward so just to visualize it now we have the test and the fool joined to so we have the test which is this file here and that full joint - which is this file here so as you can see on the first row they have exactly the same data however the second one it has another - one which has the 23rd so this one has the 27 this one has the 23rd and there is an idea this now is that later on I have joined so before I joined them by the way I have actually rename the columns into confirm - one that's - one and they recovered - one because it's going to be the day before that and then what I did is that I have joined those two datasets together so this joint down here and what I did is that I have joined the date from the first one so this date with the date - one from the second one take - one what this is gonna do is that from the 22nd is not gonna find any 27 here so it's not going much on the 23rd oh is going to find these 23rd over here by the way we also have the state and the region is three things I'm joining on so what this is going to do is that on the 23rd is going to come and attach us confirm - one the data from here so this one over here so to view it on in one data frame just to understand it better you can see that up until here is the first data set and then anything after here is the second data set so from this Ann Hui again on the 27 we have one confirm and confirm - one there was nothing to join on the 23rd now we had nine cases but on the confirm - one we actually had one case and this one case is the one case from here so this number goes here as you can see this number goes here then this number goes here and then what I did is that I have done this number - this number to get the actual of the day which is this next piece of code down here so now I have the confirmed daily which is 8 which is the difference between 9 and 1 then is 15 minus 9 is 6 then 39 minus 15 is 24 so I have the daily values now for this one state and the next step I did is that I applied applied this code on the whole day does it now not just in one state to get the numbers as I wanted them one thing to note when I ran this code in all the data set is that on the 27 so 27 for all states I get no values for confirmed daily deaths or recover just because there is no value to join as I've shown you up here however this is actually wrong we have because the data has to start from somewhere we need to update those 22 of the month which is the first date of our dataset to get the numbers from the actual confirm now what this code does is that for all three of these new fields would create at the daily one it says if the date is a 27 then go and take the number from the actual confirm that and recover these are the cumulative numbers just so we can start the data from somewhere and as we can see when we run this code now we have data for confirmed deaths and daily additionally if you'd note i've actually deleted some columns all these columns which we don't need we just use them to get their numbers but now we don't need them so I'm just dropping them and now we have our data set as we want it and the next step now is to export these data into a CSV file and then put it into power bi right going to power bi now if you want more of a newbie video on how to download use and K dashboards in power bi then I'm going to have links in the video description below but overall it's just very easy to download it you just go into Microsoft's website and you download it and it's free to use right once you do the unloaded and open it the first thing you want to do is to load some raw data so you click on data you go in to get data click on Excel and then act now you have to go into the file location where you have exported this file from Python the corona corona virus power bi row and then make sure when you're searching for it in power bi that you click on all files here so everything is going to be visible now all I have to do is select the file and click open right so you can see the file we've just created in Python and it's been loaded now in power bi and then I click load that we go to consider file on the right side so if I click on it I can actually view all the raw data file we have just created in Python so this data frame over here now is now in power bi right so now I have to start building the front end so the first few things you have to do is you have to head over in the front end then click on format page size and I want to change the type to custom and I want to set it to 15,000 2,600 I just know them now just because I have literal just finished the previous dashboard I know exactly how much space I'm going to need but usually I just put it two thousand here and then I keep building on it right so now I want to go into view and I want to change the page view into fit to it so I can use the whole page the next thing I want to do is to go to home and then change my theme I like my classic colors but you can select any color see one then I want to go into home shapes and add a line and this is going to be the line I'm gonna have for the title so if I click on line and then I where as the rotation I put it on 90 degrees we go and then I explain these timing smaller we go so here I'm going to add my title the next thing I want to do is to add a few images so I'm gonna add the my logo and then the coronavirus local at the top left where logo is actually a picture so put this here make this a bit bigger also want to go into images in the data 360 YP by the way if you're enjoying this video please click the like button and subscribe to my channel and enabling educators for future videos the next thing I want to do is to add a title so my title I click on text box and the title I'm just gonna call it paste it quickly cookies tasted Mala Mala you cannot any title you want to there we go so maybe this is actually smaller right the next thing we want to do is to add the slices so we click over here when it says slicer and the first slicer we have in our dashboard is the month and year so if I drag the month year over here actually the first thing we can see is that it add a slice it but we don't want that so I'm gonna remove it and make it at least now it's a list then I want to go into here and change the general orientation to be horizontal so now they are next to each other as we want them additionally you can see that in Python we actually had it in this format John slash 2020 and now in power bi we have the whole date which is not what we want but to change this we have to go in the began the a the reason this happened is because part bi identified these as state and not at text so we want to go in the bag and right-click on our data and go into edit the query go and find that column which is where is it month here click on it go into transform and change the data type into text actually was data just you're gonna see date but it should be text and then click or go back to home close and apply now this is going to return it into the same format as it was in Python without changing it and now if you go in the front end you can see that how to say in format is the whole month now is not just the first of the month the next thing I want to do is to change the colors so in the items I want the front color the phone to be black the background to be this then I want to use the title I want a title yes the title is going to be month yeah in the middle I want to put the size on 12 I want to put the phone to the black I don't want any back the tidal I also want to remove the slicer header there we go the next thing I want to do is to add a border and then the border is going to be the same green the first cream and then the radius is going to be 20 so we can't carry the weight now it's a bit heavy as you see right the next slicer is going to be a click on the slicer again which is going to be the date so I'll just put it over here then I track tagging it so date in the field as you can see again you created this slicer I don't want it I want drop down this time and we go drop down with the date and then I need to fix the color so I can go into the items I want to change the items I do want a title but to want a border there we go the tidal is going to be just date now I'm going to change the phone to be black put it in the middle make the text size 12 and also remove the header from there there we go and also I want to change the border to have Tony radius there we go the next thing we want to do is to copy this paste it twice because we have two more slices so one then - there we go then I want to change this one to country and region so if I go country a little and drop it on top of actually after the move date first you used to be able to do it now no you can see now this is actually it says state as actually country and region so I can go and change the title to be each one and the next one we need praveen's and state so i go back i remove the date now add province studied I can copy this name go here title placed it next thing I want to do is to add search so if I click on the host slicer and not the search so now people can actually search I'll go do the same with this one you can see this one doesn't have searched but I need to just add it there we go the next thing I'm going to do is to resize all these four slices now so I'll just select all of them go into general and here is where I connected in same size so I want the width to be 325 and the height to be 84 now I know this because I have created the previous dashboard but usually I just play with it that find the right sizes additionally I'm going to leave some more space so you can see I can move this on the right so here is what I'm going to add the number of distinct dates and the next thing I can do is to actually let me show you another thing so if I go in today it and change the select control where is it the the item background to be clean so there we go then I click on these and I click on whole and then format painter then I click on the slice up next to it you can see that it uses the same slices the same setting so I can format the painter do the same the next thing I want to do before I order them is to create another field here which is going to be the number of distinct dates and this is actually going to be a cut now so I click on the cart there we go there's no a slicer and what I want to add here is to add in the fields I want to find the date drag it in and what I want to say is to count the distinct number of days so what this is saying to me is that I have 39 days worth of data next I want let's try this let's try format this you can see it added the background at least and you know the edges at the end another thing you want to do is to remove the category and title these as the number or the string dates I want to click on wrap what so if I don't if it doesn't fit it's going to go further down now let me just put it here tell you there you go then I want to remove the size of it so if I go on the title make the size a bit a bit smaller and then make the 39 also a bit smaller so the data label so you can see it on 27 or come maybe smaller so it fits maybe 20 24 there we go and I also want to change the color into this color over here another thing I want to show you now is how to distribute all of these ones equally between each other so we can select all of them by clicking ctrl then going into format and then aligned at the at the top first just to make sure they are all aligned at the top and also distribute horizontally so now we have added them and they are the same space next to each other actually just because we have too much space I want to resize these to 144 so if I go into general into the week 244 then put this on the right yeah and then select everything again just because the the space is too much between each other distributed horizontally there we go right now I'm just going to select all of them and push them a bit up so we're using all the space in the report there we go the next thing I want to do is throughout our first section and to do these I can just click on the text box again I'm going to copy and paste the title so it could be place which is the main summary then I want to put this in the middle I want to make this a bit smaller I'm gonna take it to take all the space as you can see the in case above here so let's see I want to put it up he over here try to keep everything equally spaced with each other go then I want to add the background of light blue and I also want to add a border of light green now on to our radius 120 we go is this still visible you can see shifted a bit down so maybe we'll have to make it a bit bigger so there we go with our first section right the next thing I'm going to show you is how to create your mops and for mops I'm going to show you these two maps over here this one is provided by being and this one is provided by ArcGIS and the Bing one is actually the default one from Pompeii and the main difference is that one of them has more capability than the other so the a rgs1 has more capability which is this one however when I publish the app or the report in the web other people cannot do this one it's not supported but with the default one which is this one other people can actually do too so I'm going to show you both and you get to choose which one you want to build right the first one I'm gonna start with the ArcGIS one I want to track the long end a lot into the fields so a lot over there long over there make sure that these two fields are not aggregated because sometimes they just go in by us some by default and the map is not gonna work so make sure you don't summarize long and a lot then I want to add the size which is going to be the confirm daily so make sure you use daily and not the confirm without the daily because then it's going to be the cumulative numbers which is not what we want the next thing I want to do is to resize these so the size I want to use is 9 a 2 for width so I'm going to general when with 92 and then I'm going to use 5 4 1 4 5 5 5 1 click enter there we go the next thing I'm going to show you now is how to change the look and feel of these map but I'm just put it here but if you click on here in the three dots and you go into edit then I want to change the base map of the map to be the black one you can actually experiment with others I want the map theme now to be the one we have which is the size one but you can also do different things if you wish this which is like different groupings or a heat map but I think this one tells a better story because the bigger the bubble the more the size of confirmed cases then on the symbol size I wanted I want to keep the market I think circle is the nicest look is looking 1 I will change the field to this field over here and I want to change the outline to this outline over here it may be the thickness to be too yeah I think 2 is fine and I also want to add a ping and the ping I want to is going to be where the virus started which is in in China there you go so I think it's a nice visual just to show where the virus has started from and we kind of chose to change the color to a stronger red there we go and now if I go back to the report we have our map ready so straight away we can get inside out of this map we can actually see that the majority of the cases around China and especially around where the virus has started and in terms of Europe we can see that Italy is the one coming up with a lot most of the cases but that's and then we also have Iran I think Iran has taken up bubble but yeah you get the idea you can use the map to get insects right the next thing I'm going to do is to add a title on my map so I click on my map I go here and I click on title and then I'm going to paste the title in on the phone to be blog in the middle and I want to push it into size 12 or 13 maybe change these to Arial black maybe it looks slightly nicer also actually no I'm not gonna do that I'm gonna leave it US area and I'm gonna add a background as blue there we go additionally we want to add a border so at the border and the border is gonna be the same thing as before we do any reddish there we go nice the next thing I'm gonna do is to add a few summary statistics over here and the first one is going to be a card this card is going to be the total confirmed cases if I put it up here like these not push it a bit in and then I want to confirm daily so we can see we have 86,000 something I want to do here is the atonement to summarize this so I can go in the day that I've in the display you need I can say no because I do wanna see the whole number and I can also click on the field and make it a number so if I go into modeling now at the coma no actually there's no place no click on coma and I will go without the coma the next thing I want to do is to add the background and the same radius but I can actually click on this one go into home former painter and then click on it back and there we go it added the background now additionally we want to add title so I'll go into title and this is going to be the faces and these we want these to be us I use I don't know 14 actually let me check the size this so we have the same size as as the other dashboard so if I'm going to title title should be size 12 but this is tie size 12 and then this is size 12 and also would I want to do is to add a background and the background is going to be the same blue as this one and then we want to change the data level these 86 oh why no no the block so this 86 thousand two different text size and the text size we want is 50 so I can just select a type 50 there we go I also want to make this slightly bigger but sorry I'm using the other report to get the sizes but you can use the same as me but I can go into well is the general and decide that we'd hide 174 so I can go into general it's not far off one foot the next thing I wanna do now is to add the total deaths and tada recovery so I can cover these as it is placed it down here below and I can actually make it smaller so I'm going to put it here and the size of Ede I'm gonna go into general and I'm going to change the width to be 2 3 5 2 3 5 and I'm going to change the high to one seven six seven six there we go right and I also want to change now these from confirmed cases so from there confirmed daily to actually be the death so I can't just actually have to remove it and then put deaths and I need to click on deaths go into modeling or the command x2 it there we go also we can see the number of deaths and I also want to change as this is but we want to change the daily labor color to be read we don't cut that right so I'm going to choose a random read from here and then I can actually copy this paste it next to it right here and this is going to be the total recoveries so I can put the combat daily on top of deaths now it worked I don't know why he was not working before I can click on total recovered daily and at the coma so now it's a value and then I want to change the color of the data label to be green because this is actually good maybe not this green maybe a different green maybe this shot now I need to rename them because as you can see we have the same title in all three of them so this is actually the total deaths so I can go into the title and I can say and I can go in the title and say this is the total recovers the next thing I want to do is to calculate and show the total mortality rate or the case fatality rate I'm not an expert so some people use mortality rate some people use fatality rate but it's the same thing basically is this number divided by this number so to calculate it I'm just going to create a new measure so I can do a new measure but I'd click new measure then say CFR so I'm gonna use case fatality rate just because I don't know lots of people use this one if you want to use mortality rate actually in your line in the online one I have used where is it mortality mortality rate but it's up to you which one you will use and then the measure is going to be CFR equals it's gonna be the sum of tests tests daily divided by the rate divided by the sum of confirmed state then if I close this and then I run it and then I create another cut below which is going to be this Sun there we go but I'll say no you should be a big there we go and I contract these you know filled in now but there you go we can also click on it and add ups and H 3.42 and the same way we need to calculate the total recovery right so let me see I think this one is will be bigger then copy it paste it below and I need to create another new measure so right here I say new measure and this measure is going to be the recovery rate equals the sample recovered daily divided by the sum of what is it the confirm they close it then we have our comedy rate so if I drag it on top of there we go I also want to make these a percentage the decimals there we go now I want to rename them so I click on this one I go into title and I rename this into case fatality rate okay thought let's see it feeds and then this one I want to rename it into the recovery rate the rate hey if the titles don't fit and make sure you are just width and the length the width and the height so everything fits together so now just testing it and see every name is aligned the next thing we're going to show the next section actually is uncovered is paste it below so we can actually have a new section and the title of these new section is going to be eat the trends and forecasting so I'll copy it then I paste it right I will finish the rest of the dashboard in the next video just because this video is quite lengthy as it is in the meantime though you can use the live version so this dashboard the one which is published online to finish off the dashboard yourself to create your own visuals or to experiment with data I will try to keep this dashboard updated with the latest data in case you just want to use the dashboard and get the inside yourself and see what's going on with corona virus right I hope you enjoyed this video and if gained in a pile of this video both in writing Python code and including visuals and dashboards in power bi also getting general knowledge about what's going on with corona virus itself if you feel that you did get in this Bayou then please click the like button subscribe to my channel and enable notifications for my future videos additionally if you want try and share this dashboard with friends and family so you can they can stay updated with what's going on with corona virus around the world if you have any questions please let me know in the comments below otherwise I'm going to see you in the next video and thank you very much for watching this video\""
